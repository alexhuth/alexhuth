	I'm a neuroscience postdoc in <a href="http://gallantlab.org">Dr. Jack Gallant's laboratory</a> at UC Berkeley. I do computational fMRI. I'm interested in language and semantics. Also fMRI technology and <a href="http://pycortex.org">data visualization</a>.
	<br><br>
	In 2016 I wrote a <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17637'>neat paper</a> about how the meaning of language is represented in brain activity. I showed how models based on semantic properties of words can do <a href='http://gallantlab.org/_media/spin_performance_2.mp4'>quite well</a> at predicting fMRI responses to naturally spoken, narrative stories. Then I analyzed those models to determine which kinds of semantic properties are represented in which brain areas, creating detailed maps of semantic representation across the human cortex. It also looks like these maps are <a href='http://gallantlab.org/_media/comb_brains.mp4'>really consistent across subjects.</a> To produce a group atlas from these data I developed a <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03622'>generative model of cortical maps</a>. I also made a <a href='http://gallantlab.org/huth2016'>fancy new 3D viewer</a> for this dataset.
	<br><br>
	Back in 2012 I wrote a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312009348">paper</a> about the cortical representation of visual semantic categories. I showed that pretty much all of the higher visual cortex is semantically selective, and argued that this representation is better understood as gradients of selectivity across the cortex than as distinct areas. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9nMfaWqkVE">video</a> that explains the paper, and there's a nice <a href="http://gallantlab.org/publications/huth-et-al-2012.html">FAQ on our lab website</a>. I also made a <a href="http://gallantlab.org/semanticmovies">nifty online viewer</a> for that dataset.
	<br><br>
	I did my PhD in Dr. Jack Gallant's laboratory through the <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a> at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. Before that, I got both bachelor's and master's degrees in <a href="http://www.cns.caltech.edu/">computation and neural systems (CNS)</a> at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>. 
	<br><br>
	During my master's I worked in <a href="http://www.klab.caltech.edu/">Dr. Christof Koch's</a> laboratory, where I studied <a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/8/6/198.short">visual saliency</a> and <a href="http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20130816-103405233">decision making</a> using eye-tracking and psychophysics. While I was an undergrad at Caltech I also did a <a href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf">SURF</a> in the Koch lab, where I learned how to fMRI from <a href="http://wp.unil.ch/neuroaudio">Dr. Melissa Saenz</a> while studying <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165167/">how visual cortex reorganizes in the congenitally blind</a>.

	If you want to contact me, you can use <a href="mailto:alex.huth@gmail.com">email</a>, which is a pretty popular method. I also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_ander">twitter</a> sometimes, but I'm not very good at it. Some of the code I write ends up on <a href="https://github.com/alexhuth">github</a>.
